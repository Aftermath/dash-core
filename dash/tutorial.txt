 ## Welcome to Dash!

    This quick help guide will get you well under way to writing SQF code like an awesome-sqf-writing-guy/girl.

 # Keyboard Shortcuts

     Dash supports all the standard commands from "Ctrl + C" to copy, to "Ctrl + O" to open a file.
     However, there are a few extra ones you should know about:

     - Ctrl + /					Comment/uncomment current or selected lines
     - Ctrl + Shift +O			Open folder in treeview
     - Ctrl + I					Auto-format current line
	 - Ctrl + W					Close current tab
     - F12						Lookup selected word on Bohemia Wiki

     - Ctrl + Space				Open ArmaSense auto-complete menu
     - Ctrl + Shift + R			Rebuild ArmaSense cache (if the ArmaSense menu stops appearing, this will normally fix it)

     - Alt + Up Arrow Key		Move current or selected lines up
     - Alt + Down Arrow Key		Move current or selected lines down


 # ArmaSense				
 
     ArmaSense is the Dash SQF code-completion engine. It runs as you type and suggests a list Arma commands 
     relevant to what you're currently typing. 
     It also suggests variables that you have declared in the current file.

     You can accept ArmaSense suggestions by pressing the Tab or Enter keys. The up/down arrow keys can be used
     to select an item from the list.

     Try it out now! Start typing "call compile preprocessfilelinenumbers" on the line below:


	 Now try declaring a variable (eg. "MyVar = "test";), then try calling it on the line below:



 # Usage Hints / Tips

    - Press Ctrl + Shift + O to select a folder to load into the treeview (the right hand pane).
	- Middle click a tab to close it.
	- Select an SQF command (eg. "call", "compile") and press F12 to view that command on the Bohemia wiki.
	- Some options can be confiured in the Edit -> Settings menu.
	
	- Drag a file from a folder into the editor pane to open it
	- Press Ctrl + D to duplicate a line (WARNING: this is buggy and will empty your clipboard)

	- Dash does not prompt you to save a changed file if you close the window

	- You can use "//#region" and "//#endregion" to define collapseable regions in your code

 
 # Known Bugs

	- Opening large files in lots of tabs may cause performance issues
	- ArmaSense can be broken in some cases when opening files. 
	  TO FIX THIS: Open another file, then press Ctrl + Shift + R, then go back to the original file
	- Dash does not currently indicate if a file is "dirty" (has been changed), but it will always prompt
	  you to save it if it is different from it's original content.
	- The "Save As" feature creates an empty tab on save
	- Opening Dash with some saved tabs sometimes gives a popup with "Collection was modified. Enumerator may not enumerate"
	- Syntax highlighting doesn't work unless a file has been saved with a .sqf file extension

	- Full list of bugs can be found here: https://github.com/nevadascout/dash-core/labels/bug


 # Future Enhancements / Features

	- SQF Lexer/Parser
	- Improvements to ArmaSense to suggest variables currently in scope instead of just current file
	  (Including variables in files that aren't currently open)

	- Built-in SQF compiler which will display Microsoft Word style "wavy red underlines" for code that
	  is not compiling + suggestions on how to fix it

	- PBO Manager
	- Ability to work directly inside a PBO without needing to pack/unpack (Great for server admins!)

	- RPT File Analyser - to link directly with your source files. Dash can take you directly to the section of code
	  that has caused the error in the RPT file.

	- Scroll past end of file
	- Proper C++ syntax highlighting
	- Improved treeview
